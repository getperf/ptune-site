## Overview

**ptune** is a personal work-log management system that integrates  
**task management on mobile** with **work journaling and analysis in Obsidian**,  
helping you naturally reflect on your daily activities.

### 1. Mobile App: **ptune**
- Check today's tasks (ToDo list)
- Work with a Pomodoro-style focus timer
- Automatically record work sessions, start/end times, and completion status

### 2. Obsidian Plugin: **ptune-log**
- Create and accumulate work journals in Obsidian
- Aggregate and organize work logs
- Extract key points and keywords using AI
- Automatically summarize the day in Daily Notes and prepare for the next day

On Windows, you can also use **PtuneSync**,  
a helper tool that simplifies Google authentication and synchronization.
