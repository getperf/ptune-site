## 3. Data Storage
- This application does not store any data on its own servers.  
- It directly accesses Google Tasks cloud data provided by Google with the user’s consent.  
- For convenience, the application may temporarily cache data on the device.  
- Cached data will be deleted when the user uninstalls the app or performs the "logout" operation within the app.  
- All Google user data obtained through OAuth is limited to communication with Google APIs and local device usage only.

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure
- This application does not sell, share, transfer, or disclose any Google user data to any third party other than the developer (Minoru Furusawa).  
- The data is processed locally on the user’s device and is used only for accessing Google APIs.  
- The application does not provide any data to external advertising companies, analytics providers, or other service vendors.  

---

## 5. User Control
- To revoke account authorization, please visit [Google Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).  
- Performing "logout" within the app will delete access tokens and cached data.  
- Uninstalling the app will also remove any cached data stored on the device.  

---

## 6. Security Measures
- This application communicates directly with the Google API without using any independent servers.  
- All communication between the application and Google APIs is encrypted using HTTPS.  
- Authentication is handled using official Google libraries (FirebaseAuth, google_sign_in).  
- OAuth tokens are stored only in the secure area of the device and are never transmitted to any external third party.
